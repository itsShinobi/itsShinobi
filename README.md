## ✨ My Secret Sauce  
I don’t just analyze data; I bring it to life. Imagine:  
- **Dashboards** that answer questions before they’re even asked.  
- **Visualizations** that make numbers sing.  
- **Automation** that saves hours and delivers results faster than a morning espresso.  

I believe data is more than rows and columns—it’s a story waiting to be told. And I’m the storyteller businesses need.
